# Find-Delivery

Today most service providers (SMEs - Small and Medium Enterprises) use social media to contact customers, publish their shop/service information, collect user feedback etc and in Sri Lanka, currently, there is no community based centralized shopping platform to find the best (nearest, cheapest with the highest quality, fastest etc) shops and services. (based on community ratings, comments etc) Here this app can be used as a centralized platform to manage all these shops/services.

Furthermore, this app acts as a framework and can be easily configured to create any kind of shop specific customer management mobile solution.
